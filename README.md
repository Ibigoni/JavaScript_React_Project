# 🧮 Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web application built with **React** and **Vite** that visually demonstrates how popular algorithms work, helping users understand data structures and algorithm logic through animations, color changes, and step-by-step progression.

## 📖 Overview

The **Algorithm Visualizer** allows users to select different sorting or searching algorithms and visualize how they operate internally.  
Each algorithm runs in real time, showing array updates, swaps, comparisons, and timing data.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Interactive UI:** Built with React and styled using CSS for a clean, responsive layout.  
- ⚙️ **Multiple Algorithms:** Supports common sorting algorithms such as:
  - Bubble Sort  
  - Insertion Sort  
  - Merge Sort  
  - Quick Sort  
- ⏱️ **Step-by-Step Visualization:** Shows the internal operations of each algorithm visually.  
- 📊 **Adjustable Parameters:** Users can change array size and sorting speed.  
- 📈 **Performance Insights:** Displays the time complexity and number of operations.

## 🧠 How It Works

Each algorithm is implemented as a JavaScript function that operates on an array.  
Visual updates are handled using React’s state and asynchronous rendering.

**Formula (Sorting Complexity Example):**
> Time Complexity ≈ O(n²) for simple algorithms like Bubble or Insertion Sort,  
> and O(n log n) for efficient algorithms like Merge or Quick Sort.

The app translates each algorithm’s step into a sequence of animations, changing the color and height of visual bars to represent comparisons and swaps.
