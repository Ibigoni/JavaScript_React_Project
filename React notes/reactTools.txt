What are PropTypes?
PropTypes is a tool in React that helps you check the type of data (props) your components receive.

Think of it like this:
If you build a machine that expects only numbers, but someone gives you a string, the machine could break.
PropTypes warn you in the console when this happens, helping you catch mistakes early.

Example (without proptype)
function Welcome({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
}

<Welcome name={123} /> // Oops! Not a string! 
React won't warn you unless you use PropTypes.

Example (with proptype)
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

function Welcome({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
}

Welcome.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string.isRequired
};
<Welcome name={123} />
React will give you a warning in the console:
"Invalid prop name of type number supplied to Welcome, expected string."


In short:
PropTypes = A simple safety check for your componentâ€™s inputs (props).
